# othergrass - The grass is always greener

othergrass creates a git repository with hundreds of no-op commits to cheat the
Github profile timeline.

## Usage

    othergrass [the first day to add commits] [template file]

A template file contains one digit for each day to add commits. The number of
commits added is equal to the digit times 10. For example, a '5' in a template
file would add 50 commits on that day.
